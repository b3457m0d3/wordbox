TODO: Quiz reveal definition mechanism (not sure what it should look like yet).
TODO: Ordering of favourited words: options for chronological, alphabetical (drop down on up button thing).
TODO: Able to remove favourited words during the quiz. (i.e. mark as learned)
TODO: Partial word matches during word search.
TODO: Quiz ordering modes, not just random order.
TODO: Clear favourites option in the settings.
TODO: Remove translations from definitions.
TODO: New icon.

BUG: if you are in the list of favourited words, click a word, unfavourite it, and hit back, you get the old list of favourites (the one you just unfavourited is still there).
